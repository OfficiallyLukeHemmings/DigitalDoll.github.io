# The Digital Doll â€“ Online Interactive Performance & Exhibition (A Full-Stack Project) - December 2020


## Introduction
The Digital Doll was an interactive exhibition of performance art hosted on a website I was solely responsible for designing and creating over a 3 week period. I was enlisted by a Queen Mary University of London final year student to provide an accessible interactive platform for an assessed live performance. The website, which was deployed using Heroku, allowed for real-time voting which displayed the live sum of votes for each choice in the rounds while viewers experienced the results on Zoom.

This was a full-stack project powered by Node.js, Vue.js, Express.js, and Sockets.IO. The website was designed in an iterative fashion using Balsamiq, a wireframing tool, to create wireframes which were presented to my client and updated according to feedback.

The project was a success with the assignment being graded a high 2:1, with assignment feedback stating the website was excellently designed and served as an effective platform. It was a pleasure to undertake such an exhilarating opportunity with a creative origin, especially one where I held a lot of responsibility, as the performance was entirely reliant on the website's completion.
